# Basic Configuration
################################################################################

# Type of ModusToolbox Makefile Options include:
#
# COMBINED    -- Top Level Makefile usually for single standalone application
# APPLICATION -- Top Level Makefile usually for multi project application
# PROJECT     -- Project Makefile under Application
#
MTB_TYPE=COMBINED

# Target board/hardware (BSP).
# To change the target, it is recommended to use the Library manager
# ('make library-manager' from command line), which will also update Eclipse IDE launch
# configurations.
TARGET=APP_KIT_PSC3M5_CC2

# Name of application (used to derive name of final linked file).
#
# If APPNAME is edited, ensure to update or regenerate launch
# configurations for your IDE.
APPNAME=mtb-example-ce240243-foc-3-shunt

# Name of toolchain to use. Options include:
#
# GCC_ARM -- GCC provided with ModusToolbox software
# ARM     -- ARM Compiler (must be installed separately)
# IAR     -- IAR Compiler (must be installed separately)
#
# See also: CY_COMPILER_PATH below
TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM

# Default build configuration. Options include:
#
# Debug -- build with minimal optimizations, focus on debugging.
# Release -- build with full optimizations
# Custom -- build with custom configuration, set the optimization flag in CFLAGS
#
# If CONFIG is manually edited, ensure to update or regenerate launch configurations
# for your IDE.
CONFIG=Release


# If set to "true" or "1", display full command-lines when building.
